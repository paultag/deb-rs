//! ðŸŽ‰ You found the `deb` crate! ðŸŽ‰
//!
//! This crate is under active development, and "soft launched". *Please do
//! not post widely directing to this crate yet* -- the API shipped today is
//! unstable, and is likely to change -- fairly significantly -- without much
//! regard to very precisely following semver until it stabalizes.
//!
//! You're more than welcome to play with this and use it, but it's not
//! something I would encourage load bearing infrastructure to be written
//! with as of right now.
//!
//! # Introduction
//!
//! The `deb` crate contains utilities for working with files and formats
//! commonly found when working with Debian's project tooling, or
//! infrastructure.
//!
//! Common use-cases are broken out into modules in the `deb` crate namespace,
//! such as interacting with [control] files, parsing [dependency]
//! relationships between Debian packages, parsing and ordering [version]
//! numbers, or understanding Debian [architecture] strings.
//!
//! Docs can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/deb/latest/deb/),
//! and information about the latest release can be found on
//! [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/deb).
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! There are a few feature flags. There's no standard way to document
//! the purpose and intent, so until that's a thing, here's a markdown
//! table.
//!
//! | Flag      | Description                                                              |
//! | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
//! | `full`    | Enable all optional features.                                            |
//! | `chrono`  | Enable parsing dates using the [chrono] crate.                           |
//! | `hex`     | Enable parsing ASCII hex values using the [hex] crate                    |
//! | `serde`   | Enable support for encoding and decoding using [serde]                   |
//! | `sequoia` | Enable support for validating OpenPGP signatures using [sequoia_openpgp] |
//! | `tokio`   | Enable support for the [tokio] crate.                                    |
//!
//! # Feature `chrono`
//!
//! Enable parsing dates from ASCII into a [chrono::DateTime].
//!
//! # Feature `hex`
//!
//! Enable parsing hashes from ASCII into bytes using the `hex` crate. This
//! is only really useful in places where you're validating things like
//! digests over files in [control::changes::Changes] files, or similar.
//!
//! # Feature `serde`
//!
//! This exports two new modules for working with control files, [control::de],
//! and [control::ser] to read or write (respectively) control files in the
//! Debian RFC2822-style format, as is our convention.
//!
//! # Feature `sequoia`
//!
//! Enable functions to verify Debian control files using the [sequoia_openpgp]
//! OpenPGP implementation. This will export a few helpers throughout
//! the crate, such as [control::de::from_clearsigned_str].
//!
//! # Feature `tokio`
//!
//! Enable functions to handle places where there's an i/o boundary that is
//! handled by [tokio::io] rather than [std::io].
